        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            We use the web for so many things; ordering groceries, chatting with friends, listening to music.
            Why not use it for something... more? Helping solve the global water crisis.
            <br>
            <br>
            Water connects every aspect of life. Access to safe water and sanitation can quickly turn problems into
            potential â€“ empowering people with time for school and work, and contributing to improved health for
            women, children, and families around the world.
            <br>

            My name is <a href="http://www.ryanvanbelkum.me">Ryan VanBelkum</a>, and I am a professional web developer.
            My experience ranges from software agencies, financial tech, telematics, online and mobile food ordering
            and even some freelancing. After growing my family I decided to step away from freelancing. My full time job
            and life at home were more than enough to fill my schedule, but I have decided to take on another project
            this year. I want to build you a website, where 100% of the proceeds go straight to helping solve the global
            water crisis.
            <br>
            <br>
            So how does this work? Please submit the form below, then you and I will sit down and chat about your website needs.
            I will get you a bid, and if you accept we will get to work! 100% of the revenue I receive from your website
            will go straight to helping with the global water crisis
